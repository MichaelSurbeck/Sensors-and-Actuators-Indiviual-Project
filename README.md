# Sensors-and-Actuators-Indiviual-Project
Final part of my individual project

Using the wiring diagram and code included in the main folder, I was able to test several 
important sensor characteristics of the Keystudio KS0048 Water Level Sensor. 

These characteristics inlude the sensor's repeatability, drift, range, and linearity. 

There aren't any changes to the code for each of the tests. How you physically set up the sensor
and how and what you measure is how I was able to mathematically characterize the sensor's key 
characteristics. This is because the sensor operates by measuring the reistance gathered from the
several exposed parallel trace wires on the sensor.
